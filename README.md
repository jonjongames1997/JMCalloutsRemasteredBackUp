 JM Callouts Remastered is the remastered callout pack from the original JM Callouts BETA 
pack previously uploaded to LSPDFR.com. This callout pack will have the best callouts that I ever done. Expect a lot from this pack. Some callouts either coded by me and/or AI. 

 Version of Visual Studio that this pack uses is Visual Studio Community 2019!
